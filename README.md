# UE5_CrowdFlowSimPlugin_Demo
A pedestria crowd flow simulation tool made in Unreal Engine.
The goal is to show a non gaming application of Unreal Engine by developing an Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) oriented plugin.
The plugin aims to produce a basic and functional simulation tool while emphasizing on the development experience and work flow of Unreal Engine not
the accuracy and performance of the simulation.

This is part of a in progress final year dissertation project titled "3D ENGINES BEYOND GAMES: CROWD SIMULATION TOOL DEVELOPMENT WITH UNREAL ENGINE".

*The last pull request merged a new implementation using NavMesh, A\* and RVO2. This comes with the new class CFAgent*
